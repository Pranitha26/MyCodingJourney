# Intro
- Welcome back everyone and we were talking about the cool thing I explored in code.org!
- Today, I'm going to tell you guys wwhat I practiced in code.org
- Let's go!.

# Code.org
- I was practing the Course E Hour of Code in code.org!
- So basically, Course contain a mix of new lessons in them.
- These are some of the lessons Course E contains, The Harvester, The Artist, Sprite Lab, Minecraft and many more!.
- Now, let's go in detail about all the lessons.

## The Harvester
- By the name of the lesson, we understand that it is something about farming right?
- Yes, the harvester is a farmer and needs our help to harvest the veggies from her farm.
- We need to code to help the harvester.

## The Artist
- The artist is the painter or the lesson is on drawing.
- In this lesson, I learnt to draw some fany shapes using the artist's tool.
- They were so cool guys!

## The Sprite Lab
- Again, from the name of the lesson we understand that the word sprite means 'character'. So basically it's 'character lab'.
- Here, you can create characters and make them talk or move them and score points!
- With the help of code we can make the characters do a lot of things!

## Minecraft
- Minecraft is a very popular game, i.e, played a lot!!
- So, in this lesson we do exactly the same thing done in the game.
- The game is very simple and it's only building.
- In the lesson, we collect the items required to do the given task and we finish it!
