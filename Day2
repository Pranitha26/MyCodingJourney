Intro

Welcome back!. So, I was telling you'll what I was doing in coding!.
I was learning Python 3 and was learning the print statement.
Today, I learnt something new!.

Python

Today, I learnt variables and types.
So, a variable is like a thing containing anything. Ex a cup containg something like food, water etc.
Variables are created or defined to be used somewhere like in the print statement,i.e, 

cup("Variables are amazing!.")
print(cup)

In the above code, I've created a variable and used it in the print statement. It prints out what is being defined in the variable.

Now, let's see the types or the types of variables.
A variable can be defined as a string(a sentence marked in quotes " "), numbers.
We can define a string using the following syntax-

mystring = ("Strings are fun!")
print(mystring)

The code above prints out what is defined in the variable mystring,i.e, Strings are fun!.
-> Remember- Strings should always be put quotes(single or double).

Python supports 2 types of numbers, integers and floating point numbers. It also supports complex numbers(which I will not be talking about.
To define an integer, we can use the following syntax-

myint = 26  
 print(myint)

The following code will print the number 26.

To define a floating point number, we can use the following syntax-

myfloat = 7.0
 print(myfloat)
 
  myfloat = float(7)
   print(myfloat)

We can use both the ways to print a floating point number.
