## Intro
- Hey guys!!, we were talking about the strings and numbers in Python!.
- Today, I've got something much more interesting!.
- Are you guys excited?, well I'm very!.

## Code.org
- I explored a cool topic named the 'Star Wars', it isn't the movie! but it is something based on it.
- It's like a game where you move the character with the arrow keys on our keyboard.
- First, by default there is a robot named 'Droid' who is moved by the arrow keys.
- Then you can change the background to what you like!, so 'Star Wars', is a movie that is like in space. So, most of the backgrounds here are related to that.
- You can programme the Droid to many things namely move forward, backward, left and right. 
- Not only that but you can also create more characters like the RebelPilot, Puffer Pig etc. You can make them your enemy or just create them.
- Each of the background has an inner box and an outer box. So, you keep moving the Droid in and out.
- You can also make the Droid score and lose points!!.
